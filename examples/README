Run the examples by typing:

   y2base ./<test>.py qt

to use the graphical YaST2 user interface  (the Qt UI)
or for the text based YaST2 user interface (the NCurses UI):

   y2base ./<test>.py ncurses

Depending on your system setup, you might have to specify the absolute
path for the "y2base" command. At the time of this writing, this should be
   /usr/lib/YaST2/bin/y2base


Example:

   y2base ./ProgressBar1.py qt


Known problems

* Directory, Pkg & SCR functions are not available, examples using these
  functions may not be ported correctly, they certainly don't run. Due
  to this fact we can't check if they are actually ported fully or not.

* Examples using string literals with escaped unicode don't work as
  expected (e.g.  Label1_cs.rb, Label1_de.rb, Label1_ja.rb and others)
