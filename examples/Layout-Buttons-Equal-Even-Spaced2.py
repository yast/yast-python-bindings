      # The equal `HWeight()s will make the buttons even sized.

      # Excess space will go to the HSpacing() widgets between the
      # buttons, i.e. there will be empty space between the buttons.

      # Notice the importance of `opt(`hstretch) for the `HSpacing()s
      # here: This is what makes the HSpacing()s grow. Otherwise, they
      # would retain a constant size, and the buttons would grow.
